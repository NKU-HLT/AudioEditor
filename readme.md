# AudioEditor: A Training-Free Diffusion-Based Audio Editing Framework

[Demo Page](todo)

Diffusion-based text-to-audio (TTA) generation has made substantial progress, leveraging Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to produce high-quality, diverse and instruction-relevant audios. However, beyond generation, the task of audio editing remains equally important but has received comparatively little attention. Audio editing tasks face two primary challenges: executing precise edits and preserving the unedited sections. While workflows based on LDMs have effectively addressed these challenges in the field of image processing, similar approaches have been scarcely applied to audio editing. In this paper, we introduce AudioEditor, a training-free audio editing framework built on the pretrained diffusion-based TTA model. AudioEditor incorporates Null-text Inversion and EOT-Suppression methods, enabling the model to preserve original audio features while executing accurate edits. Comprehensive objective and subjective experiments validate the effectiveness of AudioEditor in delivering high-quality audio edits.

## üöÄ Features

- **Pre-trained Model: Auffusion**  
  We use the pre-trained model Auffusion for audio editing tasks.  
  [Auffusion Repository](https://github.com/happylittlecat2333/Auffusion/tree/main) | [Model Download Link](https://huggingface.co/auffusion/auffusion)
- **Null-text Inversion**: Ensures preservation of unedited audio portions during the editing process.
- **EOT-suppression**: Enhance the model's ability to preserve original audio
features and improve editing capabilities.
- **Support multiple audio editing operations**: Add, Delete and Replace.
- **Easy integration with other TTA models**: Plug and play with existing TTA diffuser-based models.

## üìÄ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

## ‚≠ê Usage
We will release the code for the main methods proposed in our paper after its acceptance immediately!  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Delete


<img src="docs/delete.png" alt="Delete/Add Workflow" width="500"/>

To run the deletion on an audio with a simple example, use the following command:
```bash
python main.py  --prompt "After a gunshot, there was a burst of dog barking" \
                --audio_path "audio_examples/input_audios/After a gunshot, there was a burst of dog barking.wav" \
                --token_indices "[[10,11]]" \
                --alpha "[1.,]" --cross_retain_steps "[.2,]"
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Replace

<img src="docs/replacement.png" alt="Delete/Add Workflow" width="500"/>

To run the Replacement on an audio with a simple example, use the following command:
```bash
python main.py  --prompt "After a thunder, there was a burst of dog barking" \
                --audio_path "audio_examples/input_audios/After a gunshot, there was a burst of dog barking.wav" \
                --token_indices "[[3]]" \
                --alpha "[-0.001,]" --cross_retain_steps "[.2,]"
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Add
<img src="docs/add.png" alt="Delete/Add Workflow" width="500"/>

```bash
python main.py  --prompt "A woman is giving a speech amid applause" \
                --audio_path "audio_examples/input_audios/A woman is giving a speech.wav" \
                --token_indices "[[7,8]]" \
                --alpha "[-0.001,]" --cross_retain_steps "[.2,]"
```
